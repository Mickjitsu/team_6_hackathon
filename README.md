##### Colour Scheme

The color scheme was detected from the hero image and chosen to create a warm and harmonious atmosphere.

A limited color palette is used to avoid visual clutter.

![color-palette](./documentation/color-palette.png)

[Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/ffffff-3d2617) was used to validate color contrast for web accessibility in terms of readability.

![color contrast](./documentation/color-contrast.png)

##### Fonts

[Rototo slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?query=roboto+slab) was chosen as the primary font for a classy look with a focus on readability. The font is variable and offers a range of weights, making it suitable for various design elements.

##### Wireframes

The wireframes were created using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).

## ![logo-dark-xs](./documentation/logo-dark-xs.png) Agile Methodology

This project utilizes Agile Development Methods to manage development and ensure efficient delivery.

##### EPICS (Milestones)

The epics represent the high-level objectives and functionalities of the project. These can be further divided into granular tasks, as defined in the user stories. 

##### User Stories Issues

Detailed descriptions that outline the project's functionalities from the user's perspective. 

For details to the Epics and User Stories, please visit the project's [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/Mickjitsu/projects/3).

##### The MoSCoW Prioritization Method

The acronym stands for Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have. To effectively manage resources and development flow, based on urgency and necessity, the prioritization method MoSCoW was employed. 

A structural approach to determine which features are essential for the current stage (Must Have), which can be incorporated if time allows (Should Have), which might be deferred for later iterations (Could Have), and which are excluded from this iteration or unlikely to be implemented (Won't Have). 
The priorities are reflected with **labels** on each user story on [this project's Kanban board](https://github.com/users/Mickjitsu/projects/3)

## ![logo-dark-xs](./documentation/logo-dark-xs.png) Features

##### Navbar

The website uses a clean layout with a clear visual hierarchy for easy navigation.
The user's current location on the website is always indicated in the navigation bar.
Navigation elements (links and buttons) are prominently placed and clearly labeled.

##### Footer

The footer is minimalistic and contains only copyright related information about the project.

##### Home

The Home page is a visually appealing introduction to the website, with a hero image and a brief description of what the website has to offer.

![feature-home](./documentation/feature-home.png)

##### Practice Mode

The Practice Mode allows users to play a musical game with a piano keyboard. The game provides a fun and engaging way to learn and practice musical skills without any validation of the user's performance.

![feature-choice](./documentation/feature-choice.png)

The user can choose between two difficulty levels: Easy and Hard.

![feature-practice](./documentation/feature-practise.png)

##### Game Mode

The Game Mode allows users to play a musical game with a piano keyboard. The game provides a fun and engaging way to learn and practice musical skills with validation of the user's performance. The user gets a score based on their performance.

##### Error Pages

The project uses a custom HTML error page for status code 404 (Not Found) for improved user experience. The error page maintains a consistent design with the rest of the website, clearly explains the meaning of the error code in a user-friendly way avoiding technical jargon, and uses clear, concise language. The error page displays a friendly image in line with the website theme to make the error page more visually appealing.

![error-page](./documentation/custom-error-404.PNG)

##### Future Features

The game is coded in a way that it can be quickly extended to include more features and functionalities. The logic for playing the instrument compared to the song notes can be used for further songs and keyboard instruments.

Dark Mode would be a nice addition to the game but this was beyond the scope of this project.
